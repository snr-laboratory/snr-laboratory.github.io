# Join us

We welcome highly self-motivated individuals to join our quest. Whether you are a student, postdoc, or professional, you must be willing to conquer any obstacles in the way to achieve goals. Siloed domain experts are NOT welcome.

We expect you to be a standout communicator, able to deliver technical information with clarity and precision, both orally and in writing. You shall also bring enthusiasm and leadership to inspire your colleagues, co-workers, and vendors, motivating everyone to go above and beyond in reaching the objectives.

For prospective team members, we follow the ``first we try, then we trust'' principle. Interested individuals shall be supported to do a small trial project on a subject mutually agreed upon before becoming a formal member of the team. By driving the project, you will get a chance to assess whether our style and activities suit you. The team will also assess if you are likely to flourish in what we do.

## Current openings

### Postdoctoral fellow (as of 202502)

The UTA Department of Physics invites applications for a postdoctoral fellow position. The group, led by Prof. Yuan Mei, develops novel sensors, detectors, and concepts for neutrino physics research and a broad range of applications. Active research areas include deterministic creation of qubits, CMOS ASICs that work in cryogenic (77K) and deep-cryogenic (<1K) environments, CMOS charge sensors and sensor networks that operate in gaseous and liquid time projection chambers (TPC), and CMOS circuits coupled with novel materials such as aSe, Perovskite, nanomaterials, etc. for sensing. We also design radiation-hard circuits and qualify/understand them through radiation measurements. Successful candidates are free to work on any of these areas and/or bring fresh ideas. A demonstrated systematic view and the capability to plan through physical arguments, simulation, and machine learning (ML)-assisted optimization are more appreciated over specific technical skills. At the candidate's choosing, coaching is provided for mastering engineering skills such as optics, CMOS integrated circuit design, test, post-processing, PCB, FPGA, readout, etc. We strongly encourage physicists with original ideas on experiments and measurements to apply.

Email [contact@snr-lab.org](mailto:root@snr-lab.org?subject=SNR Lab join us) to apply.

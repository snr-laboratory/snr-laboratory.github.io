We adopt the ``chokepoint removal'' approach to problem solving and project planning.  A chokepoint in our definition is the most pressing issue that hinders the progress.  While not losing sight on the big picture, we always attack the most significant issue head-on and stay away from even the second most important one.  Priority matters.  The greatest progress is made by removing the chokepoint today rather than working on a problem that may need solving tomorrow.  Tomorrow's problem changes because of today's progress.

# Lab rules

Group members are expected to follow a set of ground rules in order to excel.

## Data management

Each group member shall be given access to the Lab-owned git repo, wiki, Google Drive, (La)TeX doc (overleaf), and server accounts.  All work is to be conducted on these services.  Local copies are ephemeral and are deemed nonexistent.  ``I forgot to upload'' is never an excuse.  Learn to use the tools well so that data are always synchronized.

Email [root@snr-lab.org](mailto:root@snr-lab.org?subject=SNR Lab accounts) to ask for an account or a new repo to be created.

## We write things down

Information, especially human thoughts, insights, and plans, is volatile if not written down.  We write things down for rigorous book keeping and information sharing.  Write in the way of letters and documents.  Acceptable forms of writing are, in descending order of preference, markdown (in .md or in Jupyter notebook) in git repo, Google Doc, and (La)TeX doc.

Slides are *not* a form of writing.  They allow the creator to be lazy while imposing extra work guessing and searching on the audience, who might be future you!  Slides are only prepared for conference talks.  Do not bring slides to (group) meetings to show results.  Bring a URL that points to your writing.

## We share and help each other

By default, all information is visible to all group members.  While each member will champion their own projects, everyone is encouraged to learn from each other and cross-pollinate ideas.

$$ c_0 y + c_1 \frac{\partial y}{\partial n} = f $$

When in doubt, email [root@snr-lab.org](mailto:root@snr-lab.org?subject=SNR Lab rules) for clarification.

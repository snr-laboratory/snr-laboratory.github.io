## Jekyll

On macOS, after installing macports, `gem` and `ruby` should be available.  Run `gem install jekyll` to install jekyll under `~/.gem/`.

`cd` into the repo of the site, then run `jekyll serve` to serve the site locally and monitor any source file changes.  If `Gemfile` or gem version related errors occur, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` instead.

By default the local server can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.

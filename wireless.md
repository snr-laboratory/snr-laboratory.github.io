In numerous practical scenarios, the complete wireless operation of sensors and actuators is highly advantageous.  This implies not only the wireless transmission of signals but also the cable-free delivery of power.

A prime example is in environments such as vacuum or high-pressure chambers.  Utilizing wired connections in these settings necessitates feed-throughs, which introduce complexity, potential failure points, and incur substantial costs.  The possibility to deploy pressure, temperature, current, voltage sensors, etc., as well as motion manipulators, without any wire connections significantly enhances the system.

Imagine a double-beta decay detector employing a chamber without feed-throughs?  Perhaps with only gas handling ports?
